   <h1>Understanding Heart Failure: Types and Symptoms</h1> 
   <p>Our Heart Failure Prediction webpage is designed to help individuals assess their risk for different types of heart failures based on various medical factors.</p> 
   <p>Heart failure is a serious medical condition that can occur in different forms, each with their own unique symptoms and risk factors. By understanding the type of heart failure you may be at risk for, you can take proactive steps to manage your health and seek medical attention if necessary.</p>

       <h2>Systolic Heart Failure</h2> <p>Type 1 heart failure, also known as systolic heart failure, occurs when the heart's lower chambers, the ventricles, are unable to contract normally, resulting in a reduced ejection fraction.</p> <p>Symptoms of type 1 heart failure can include shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention. Risk factors for this type of heart failure include coronary artery disease, previous heart attacks, and high blood pressure.</p>

          <p>Type 2 heart failure, also known as diastolic heart failure, occurs when the heart's lower chambers are stiff and unable to fill properly with blood during the diastolic phase.</p> 
      <p>Symptoms of type 2 heart failure can include shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention. Risk factors for this type of heart failure include diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity.</p>

         <h2>Congestive Heart Failure</h2> <p>Congestive heart failure occurs when the heart's pumping ability is impaired, leading to a backup of fluid in the body's tissues. This type of heart failure can affect both the right and left sides of the heart.</p> <p>Symptoms of congestive heart failure can include shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention in the lungs, legs, and abdomen. Risk factors for this type of heart failure include coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and valvular heart disease.</p>

       <p>Our webpage uses a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of medical records to help predict your risk for different types of heart failures based on various medical factors.</p>
    <p>We hope that our webpage can help raise awareness about heart failure and encourage individuals to take proactive steps to manage their health. Thank you for visiting our webpage!</p>
